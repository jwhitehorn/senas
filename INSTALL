To Install Senas on your machine, first make sure you have
meet the requirements. Your will need:

*) A Unix-like OS. (Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X, etc)
*) Perl version 5.8 (with iThreads)
*) PostgreSQL 8.0 or higher
*) Root access

At the moment Senas can only be installed by a user
with root privileges.

In addition to the above, you will need some Perl modules.
Modules can be installed using CPAN. You will need:

*) DBI
*) DBD::Pg
*) LWP::RobotUA
*) URI
*) Time::HiRes
*) Digest::MD5
*) MIME::Base64

try typing,
	perl -MCPAN -e 'shell'
and at the prompt type
	install MODULE
where MODULE is each of the above module names.

Once you have installed all of the requirements, you will need 
to setup a database for Senas. Located in this same directory is 
a file called 'search.psql'. Simply create a database, and then
execute the commands from that file.

For example, from a PSQL prompt type:
	\i /home/jason/search.psql

Assuming /home/jason is the directory in which search.psql resides. 

Once you have reached this point, run the installer.pl 
script as root. You have been running as root, right?

This automated script will help you install Senas itself.

Once you have reached this point all that remains is to add symbolic
links to the Senas daemons. This is only required if you want Senas
to start automatically when your system boots.

On systems similar to Red-Hat Linux, try
	ln -s /usr/local/senas/bin/oracle.pl /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S99oracle
assuming that you installed Senas in /usr/local, and that you
desire the oracle to startup on run-level 3.

You will have to manually edit a line in simon.pl, and enter your own email 
address. This contact information is what is displayed in web site 
administrators logs, so be friendly and identify yourself.
